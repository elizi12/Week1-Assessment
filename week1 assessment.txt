
1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):

Definition:
IaaS(Infrastruture as a Service) provides virtualized computing resources over the internet, allowing users to rent infrastructure components like virtual machines, storage, and networks on a pay-as-you-go basis.

Examples of IaaS:

Virtual Machines (VMs)
Storage (block and object storage)
Networking (firewalls, load balancers)

Use cases, such as:

Scalable Web Applications: IaaS enables businesses to scale their web applications by dynamically adjusting computing resources based on demand.
Development and Testing Environments: Developers can quickly provision and de-provision infrastructure for testing purposes without the need for physical hardware.



PaaS provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the complexities of underlying infrastructure.

Examples of PaaS:

Development frameworks
Databases
Middleware

Use Cases, such as:
Application Development: PaaS accelerates application development by providing pre-configured environments, reducing the time spent on infrastructure management.
Data Analysis: Data scientists can utilize PaaS for building and deploying analytical models without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.



Software as a Service (SaaS):

Definition:
SaaS delivers software applications over the internet, allowing users to access and use the software without worrying about maintenance, updates, or infrastructure.

Examples of SaaS:

Email services (e.g., Gmail)
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software (e.g., Salesforce)
Office productivity suites (e.g., Microsoft 365)

Use Cases, such as:
Collaboration and Productivity: SaaS applications like Google Workspace or Microsoft 365 facilitate seamless collaboration and productivity across teams.
Cost-Effective Solutions: Businesses can leverage SaaS solutions without the need for significant upfront investment in software licenses and infrastructure.

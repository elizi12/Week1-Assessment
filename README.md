Week 1 Assessment - Introduction to Cloud Computing and
Linux Administration
Assignment 1: Understanding Cloud Computing

1. Research Task: Write a brief report on the following cloud service models:
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):  IaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the internet, allowing users to rent infrastructure components like virtual machines, storage, and networks on a pay-as-you-go basis.

Examples of IaaS:Virtual Machines (VMs), Storage (block and object storage), Networking 
(Firewalls, load balancers).

Use Cases, Such As:
Scalable Web Applications: IaaS enables businesses to scale their web applications by dynamically adjusting computing resources based on demand.


- Platform as a Service (PaaS): PaaS provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the complexities of underlying infrastructure.

Examples of PaaS:
Development frameworks
Databases

Use Cases, Such AS:
Data Analysis: Data scientists can utilize PaaS for building and deploying analytical models without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.


- Software as a Service (SaaS): SaaS delivers software applications over the internet, allowing users to access and use the software without worrying about maintenance, updates, or infrastructure.

Examples of SaaS:
Email services (e.g., Gmail)
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software (e.g., Salesforce)
Office productivity suites (e.g., Microsoft 365)

Use Cases, Such As:
Collaboration and Productivity: SaaS applications like Google Workspace or Microsoft 365 facilitate seamless collaboration and productivity across teams.

2. Practical Task: Sign up for a free tier account on a cloud platform (AWS, Google Cloud, or 
Azure are suggested). Create a simple instance and document the steps you followed.

Answer: Documentation of the Creation of a Simple Instance (Azure)

Assignment 2: Linux Commands Hands-on
1. Research Task: Write a brief explanation of the following Linux commands:
  - â€˜ ls`: Lists files and directories in the current directory.
- `cd`: Navigates to a specified directory.
- `pwd`: Displays the current working directory path.
- `touch`: Creates an empty file or updates file timestamps.
- `rm`: Deletes files or directories.
- `cp`: Copies files or directories from one location to another.
- `mv`: Moves or renames files and directories. 
- `cat`: Displays the contents of a file.
- `echo`: Prints text or variables to the terminal.
- `man`: Displays the manual or help pages for a command.
- `sudo`: Executes a command with elevated privileges.
- `apt-get`: Package management tool for Debian-based systems.
- `chmod`: Modifies file permissions (read, write, execute).
- `chown`: Changes the ownership of a file or directory.

2. Practical Task: Install a Linux distribution (Ubuntu is suggested) on a virtual machine (VirtualBox is suggested) but you can use WSL or Vagrant. Practice using the commands you researched and document your experience.
